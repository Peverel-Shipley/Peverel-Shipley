## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Pev, and I am a senior double majoring mathematics with an emphasis in statistics and economics at the University of Nevada, Reno. I have a strong understanding of statistics and data in both professional and academic settings. Through internships, schoolwork, personal projects, and research, I am experienced in exploratory data analyses, cleaning and transforming data, statistical modeling, machine learning, forecasting, data visualization, and programming. Following my graduation in the Spring of 2025, I hope to begin my PhD in the Fall, where I aim to deepen my expertise in advanced analytics, machine learning, and statistical modeling while contributing to cutting-edge research that addresses real-world problems. In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have a passion for the community and civic involvement through my work with the Associated Students of the University of Nevada, the Boy Scouts of America, the National Honor Society, and other wonderful organizations.
